This project applies Linear Regression to predict house prices using a dataset containing features such as size (in square feet), number of rooms, and location (urban, suburban, rural). The goal is to build a predictive model that helps understand how these factors influence house pricing. The process begins with data loading and exploration, handling missing values, and performing exploratory analysis to check distributions and detect outliers. Next, we preprocess the data by normalizing numerical features using StandardScaler and encoding categorical variables like Location using one-hot encoding. Correlation analysis is used to select the most relevant features, which are then fed into a linear regression model trained on 80% of the dataset. The remaining 20% is used for testing. The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score, providing insight into prediction accuracy and explanatory power. Key results reveal that both house size and the number of rooms strongly influence price, with urban locations typically associated with higher values. This project showcases the practical use of regression modeling in real estate analytics and demonstrates essential steps in building, training, and evaluating a machine learning model using Python.
